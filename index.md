## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="dong.jpg">

I am currently a 5th year PhD student in Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS), Tsinghua University. My advisor is [Prof. Jian Li](http://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jianli/).

Before that, I received the B. Sc degree from Department of Computer Science of China University of Mining Technology.

My research interests includes machine learning, deep learning, and their application in spatio-temporal data.
